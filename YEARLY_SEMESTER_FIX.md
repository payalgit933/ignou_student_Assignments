# 🎯 Yearly vs Semester Exam Logic Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved

The issue where choosing "Yearly" exam type showed no courses has been completely fixed! Now the system properly handles both yearly and semester exams with different course selections.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Yearly Exam Logic:**
- **Before**: Choosing "Yearly" showed no courses because system was looking for semester-based courses
- **After**: Yearly exams now show appropriate yearly courses based on calendar year selection

### **2. Dynamic Year Options:**
- **Before**: Year dropdown always showed same options regardless of exam type
- **After**: Year options change dynamically based on exam type selection

### **3. Course Data:**
- **Before**: Only semester-based courses existed
- **After**: Added 40+ yearly courses across all programs and years

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **For Yearly Exams:**
1. **Select "Yearly"** → Semester field disappears
2. **Year options change to**: 2024, 2025, 2026 (calendar years)
3. **Select a year** (e.g., 2024) → Shows yearly courses for that year
4. **No semester selection needed** → Courses are organized by calendar year

### **For Semester Exams:**
1. **Select "Semester"** → Semester field appears
2. **Year options change to**: 1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year (academic years)
3. **Select year and semester** (e.g., 1st Year + 1st Semester) → Shows semester courses
4. **Both selections required** → Courses are organized by academic year and semester

## 📊 **Course Examples:**

### **Yearly Exam Courses:**
- **MBA + 2024 + Yearly** → Management Functions (Yearly), HR Management (Yearly), etc.
- **MBA + 2025 + Yearly** → Strategic Management (Yearly), Operations Management (Yearly), etc.
- **BCA + 2024 + Yearly** → Computer Basics (Yearly), Basic Mathematics (Yearly), etc.

### **Semester Exam Courses:**
- **MBA + 1st Year + 1st Semester** → Management Functions, HR Management, Economics, etc.
- **MBA + 1st Year + 2nd Semester** → Marketing, Information Systems, Organizational Behaviour, etc.
- **BCA + 3rd Year + 2nd Semester** → E-Commerce, Unix Programming, Microprocessors, etc.

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation:**

### **Database Changes:**
- Added 40+ yearly courses with proper year/semester mapping
- Yearly courses use calendar years (2024, 2025, 2026) as "year" field
- Yearly courses use "Yearly" as "semester" field
- Semester courses use academic years (1st Year, 2nd Year, etc.) as "year" field
- Semester courses use proper semester names (1st Semester, 2nd Semester, etc.)

### **Frontend Logic:**
- Dynamic year dropdown updates based on exam type selection
- Proper parameter mapping for API calls
- Clear validation messages for different exam types
- Automatic course reload when exam type changes
