# ðŸŽ¯ Exam Type Logic Fix - Proper Separation

## âœ… **Complete Fix Implemented!**

The exam type logic has been completely fixed to work properly with clear separation between Yearly and Semester exams.

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Proper Exam Type Logic:**
- **Yearly Exams**: Only require Year selection (1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year)
- **Semester Exams**: Only require Semester selection (1st Semester, 2nd Semester, 3rd Semester, 4th Semester)
- **No Intersection**: Year and Semester selections don't interfere with each other

### **2. Updated Year Options:**
- **Yearly**: Shows academic years (1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year)
- **Semester**: Year field shows "Not Required" and is disabled
- **Clear Separation**: Each exam type has its own logic

### **3. Database Structure Updated:**
- **Yearly Courses**: Organized by academic years (1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year) with semester = "Yearly"
- **Semester Courses**: No year required, organized by semester only (1st Semester, 2nd Semester, etc.)
- **Proper Course Codes**: Different course codes for yearly vs semester courses

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now:**

### **For Yearly Exams:**
```
1. Select "Yearly" exam type
2. Year dropdown shows: 1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year
3. Semester field is hidden (not required)
4. Select program + year
5. API call: /api/courses/filter?program=MBA&year=1st%20Year&semester=Yearly
6. Shows yearly courses for that academic year
```

### **For Semester Exams:**
```
1. Select "Semester" exam type
2. Year field shows "Not Required" (disabled)
3. Semester field is visible and required
4. Select program + semester
5. API call: /api/courses/filter?program=MBA&semester=1st%20Semester
6. Shows semester courses for that semester
```

## ðŸ“Š **Database Structure:**

### **Yearly Courses (Academic Years):**
```
Program | Year      | Semester | Course Code | Course Name
--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------
MBA     | 1st Year  | Yearly   | MMPC-101    | Management Functions and Behaviour
MBA     | 2nd Year  | Yearly   | MMPC-201    | Advanced Management Functions
MBA     | 3rd Year  | Yearly   | MMPC-301    | Executive Management Functions
MBA     | 4th Year  | Yearly   | MMPC-401    | Senior Management Functions
```

### **Semester Courses (No Year Required):**
```
Program | Year | Semester     | Course Code | Course Name
--------|------|--------------|-------------|-------------
MBA     | ""   | 1st Semester | MMPC-S01    | General Management Principles
MBA     | ""   | 2nd Semester | MMPC-S04    | Advanced Business Concepts
MBA     | ""   | 3rd Semester | MMPC-S07    | Strategic Management
MBA     | ""   | 4th Semester | MMPC-S10    | Executive Management
```

## ðŸ”„ **Updated Form Logic:**

### **JavaScript Changes:**
```javascript
function updateExamTypeSelection() {
    const examType = document.querySelector('input[name="examType"]:checked').value;
    
    if (examType === 'Yearly') {
        // Show academic years, hide semester
        yearSelect.innerHTML = '<option value="">Select year</option>';
        // Add: 1st Year, 2nd Year, 3rd Year, 4th Year
        semesterGroup.style.display = 'none';
    } else if (examType === 'Semester') {
        // Hide year selection, show semester
        yearSelect.innerHTML = '<option value="">Not Required</option>';
        semesterGroup.style.display = 'block';
    }
}
```

### **API Call Logic:**
```javascript
// For yearly exams
if (examType === 'Yearly' && year) {
    params.append('year', year);
    params.append('semester', 'Yearly');
}

// For semester exams
if (examType === 'Semester' && semester) {
    params.append('semester', semester);
}
```
